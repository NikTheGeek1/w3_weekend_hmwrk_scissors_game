            Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings
            of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being
            called "stone", roshambo or ro-sham-bo) is a hand
            game usually played between two people, in which
            each player simultaneously forms one of three
            shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes
            are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand),
            and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger
            and middle finger extended, forming a V).
            "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered
            V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace")
            except that it is pointed horizontally instead
            of being held upright in the air.
